# Speech Synthesis

---

## The Speech Synthesis project is one of the 30 coding challenges designed by Wes Bos. This particular challenge focuses on using the Web Speech API to build a simple text-to-speech application that can convert written text into spoken words.

To complete the challenge, participants are tasked with building a web page that includes a text input field and a button. When the user types in some text and clicks the button, the application should use the Web Speech API to generate an audio file that reads the text aloud in a computer-generated voice. The user should be able to play and pause the audio file, as well as adjust the speed and pitch of the voice.

The Web Speech API is a JavaScript API that allows developers to access speech recognition and speech synthesis capabilities in web browsers. It provides a simple interface for converting text to speech and vice versa, and supports a variety of languages and voices.
This is JavaScript30 Challenge. In this project, applications were made for text reading functions.
